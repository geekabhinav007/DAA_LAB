# Dynamic Programming

## What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

## Why Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic programming is used when the same subproblems are called again and again. In dynamic programming, computed solutions to subproblems are stored in a table so that these donâ€™t have
to computed again.

## How Dynamic Programming Works?

1. Identify the subproblems
2. Guess the part of the solution
3. Relate the subproblem solutions
4. Recurse and memoize or build the solution bottom-up
5. Solve the original problem

## difference between dynamic programming and greedy algorithm?

1. Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. Dynamic programming is quite the opposite. It combines solutions to subproblems in order to give the overall optimum.

2. Greedy algorithms can be used for optimization problems. Dynamic programming is mainly used for counting problems. But there are also optimization problems that admit a dynamic programming solution.

3. Greedy algorithms can be used for many problems, whereas dynamic programming is used only for certain problems.

4. Greedy algorithms are in general easier to implement than dynamic programming, and vice versa.

## What is the difference between top-down and bottom-up approach?

1. Top-down approach is recursive. Bottom-up approach is iterative.

2. Top-down approach starts with the problem and breaks it down into subproblems. Bottom-up approach starts with the subproblems and combines them to solve the problem.

3. Top-down approach is usually more intuitive. Bottom-up approach is usually more efficient.

4. Top-down approach is usually implemented using recursion. Bottom-up approach is usually implemented using iteration.

## What is the difference between memoization and tabulation?

1. Memoization is top-down approach. Tabulation is bottom-up approach.

2. Memoization is recursive. Tabulation is iterative.

3. Memoization is usually implemented using recursion. Tabulation is usually implemented using iteration.

4. Memoization is usually implemented using a hash table. Tabulation is usually implemented using an array.

## What is the difference between optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems?

1. Optimal substructure is a property of the problem. Overlapping subproblems is a property of the algorithm.

2. Optimal substructure is a property of the problem. Overlapping subproblems is a property of the algorithm.

3. Optimal substructure is a property of the problem. Overlapping subproblems is a property of the algorithm.

4. Optimal substructure is a property of the problem. Overlapping subproblems is a property of the algorithm.

## What is the difference between divide and conquer and dynamic programming?

1. Divide and conquer is top-down approach. Dynamic programming is bottom-up approach.

2. Divide and conquer is recursive. Dynamic programming is iterative.

3. Divide and conquer is usually implemented using recursion. Dynamic programming is usually implemented using iteration.

4. Divide and conquer is usually implemented using a stack. Dynamic programming is usually implemented using a queue.
