# Divide and Conquer

## What is Divide and Conquer Method?

Divide and Conquer is a problem-solving paradigm used in computer science and mathematics. The idea behind the divide and conquer method is to break down a complex problem into smaller and simpler subproblems that can be solved independently. Then, the solutions to the subproblems are combined to obtain the final solution to the original problem.
