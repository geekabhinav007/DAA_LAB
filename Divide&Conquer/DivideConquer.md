# Divide and Conquer

## What is Divide and Conquer Method?

Divide and Conquer is a problem-solving paradigm used in computer science and mathematics. The idea behind the divide and conquer method is to break down a complex problem into smaller and simpler subproblems that can be solved independently. Then, the solutions to the subproblems are combined to obtain the final solution to the original problem.

### Algorithm based on Divide and Conquer

1. [Binary Search](binarySearch.cpp)

> Time Complexity of Binary Search: O(log n)

2. [Recursive Binary Search](RecursiveBinarySearch.cpp)

> Time Complexity of Binary Search: O(log n)

3. [Merge Sort](mergeSort.cpp)

> Time Complexity of Merge Sort: O(n log n)

4. [Quick Sort](QuickSort.cpp)

> Time Complexity of Quick Sort: Best Case: O(n log n) --> When the pivot is always the middle element of the array and Worst Case: O(n^2) --> (When the array is already sorted.)

5. [Finding Maximum and Minimum Elements in an Array](FindingMax_and_Min.cpp)

> Time Complexity of Finding Maximum and Minimum Elements in an Array: O(n)

6. **Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
