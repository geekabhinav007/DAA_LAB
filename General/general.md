## Diffference between Algorithm and Program?

An algorithm is a step by step procedure to solve a problem. It is a finite set of instructions to solve a problem. It is a set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language to perform a specific task. It is a collection of instructions that perform a specific task when executed by a computer.

## Priori Analysis vs Posteriori Analysis

Priori Analysis is a method of estimating the time complexity of an algorithm before the algorithm is implemented. It is based on the assumption that the algorithm is implemented in the best possible way.

Posteriori Analysis is a method of estimating the time complexity of an algorithm after the algorithm is implemented. It is based on the actual implementation of the algorithm.

## Characteristics of an Algorithm

An algorithm should be:

- **Unambiguous or Definiteness**: The algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. It should not be vague or ambiguous.

- **Input**: The algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.

- **Output**: The algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.

- **Finiteness**: The algorithm should terminate after a finite number of steps.

- **Effectiveness**: The algorithm should be effective in terms of time and space.
