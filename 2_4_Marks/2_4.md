## Define Time Complexity of an Algorithm

```text
Time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input to the algorithm increases. It is a way to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the resources (primarily time).

The time complexity of an algorithm is usually expressed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time as the input size increases.

The function f(n) which gives the running time and or space in terms of the input size n is called the time complexity of the algorithm.

## What is Asymptotic Notation?

```text
Asymptotic notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

Asymptotic notation is used to:
- Describe the complexity of an algorithm
- Compare the complexity of different algorithms
- Predict the complexity of an algorithm for a given input size
